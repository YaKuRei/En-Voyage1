                <h3>Our accommodations were organised by our travel agency. We stayed with local host families. This experience has really helped me learn new things about the Scottish culture. Me and my two best friends stayed with a very nice couple. Our host dad was a very cheerful elderly man and our host mother cooked the most amazing dishes. At dinner table, we had long conversations where our host dad would tell us stories about his life and places he has travelled to. He in fact took a day off from work just to spend time with us and show us around the city. He drove us to the beach, took us to the famous Fourth Bridge and to the Ocean Terminal, a shopping mall near a harbour. The view from the Ocean Terminal is just stunning!</h3>

Unlike regular classes, the sessions were held in workshop-like setting and were designed to be very interactive. Our teacher Jamie is a theatre actor who pushed us to come out of our comfort zone and give acting a try. I never thought I could ever do that but this has definitely boosted my self-confidence!</h3>

Our tour guide appeared in traditional clothing, the kilt. We even went to the Elephant House, the café, where J.K. Rowling used to sit and write Harry Potter. However, the best thing was when we went to a graveyard near the café and found some character names of Harry Potter on the gravestones. Now it’s all out where J.K. Rowling got her inspiration!</h3>

At night, we walked around the old town of Edinburgh and heard darkest stories from the Scottish history about witch executions. The tour guide was a witty man dressed up as vampire and there were people hidden at some spots to scare us. For those who love to be thrilled, I would also highly recommend visiting Edinburgh Dungeon.</h3>

                <h3>My favourite restaurant in Edinburgh is by far Henderson’s Of Edinburgh. At first, my friends and I struggled to find a good vegetarian food place until we came across this restaurant. It is located in the city centre or the New Town and was very close to our language school. We nearly went there every day for lunch and it’s a heaven for vegetarians. Although the restaurant is in a basement, the ambience there is really pleasant. The staff is very friendly, and, in the evening, they play live jazz music. On a side note, for all art-lovers, they promote local artists by exhibiting their edgy and contemporary art pieces. The most amazing thing about this place is that they make traditional Scottish meat-based food, such as haggis, completely meatless! Therefore, we didn’t miss out on anything!
                Of course, there many other fancy restaurants both in the Old Town and New Town. Feel free to check them out as well.</h3>
                <h3>Overall, it was an amazing enriching experience. I made new connections, learned some Scottish expressions and slangs and had amazing food. However, we struggled a bit with the language because their accent was very hard to understand. Nevertheless, the people there were very warm, welcoming and helpful. I would highly recommend everyone to visit Edinburgh. This city is definitely worth your time!
                  A final tip, always carry an extra jacket and an umbrella. The wheather there can change instantly.</h3>
