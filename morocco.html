                <h2>When to go</h2>
                <h3>The best time is from mid-March to May and followed by between September and November</h3>
                <h2>Languages</h2>
                <h3>The official languages are Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and French. English for most tourists’ places is also ok.</h3>
                <h2>Currency</h2>
                <h3>Moroccan dirham (MAD) is the official currency. E.g. 100Dh</h3>

                <h3>Marrakesh is the first city we went to. After arriving at the hotel, we all felt tried because of the hot climate. We just stayed in the hotel and swam in the pool. And when it was cooler in the evening, we went to the Djemaa el-Fna, which is a really messy square I cannot imagine!</h3>
                <h3>Too many people and so crowded, the only thing I remembered is the extreme juggling. And my favourite interest is Jardin Majorelle. This is a garden bought by Yves Saint Laurent, who is a famous man who deeply fell love with this blue garden just as me. If you want to take a lot of photos, don’t miss it and just spend time here as much as you can.</h3>

                <h3>And I really want to share you with a restaurant called Café Clock. This café has three layers. We had our dinner including chicken and beef tajine and two cups of mango lassi in the open-air/top one. There are also several lovely cats always jumping from a table to another one. I thought Morocco is really growing on me when I saw them.</h3>

                <h3>Before buying any product, the cutting price is a necessary process, please don’t be shy and try your best to bargain since most sellers are very crafty.</h3>
                <h3>If you are a female, don’t be afraid of gazing from the local man since the term of religious reasons, most local women-only expose their eyes when they walk on the street. (but you also cannot dress outrageously)</h3>
                <h3>Please take the responsibility of travelling, as much as possible to protect the environment or local culture and historical remains.</h3>
